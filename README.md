# Zoom Zoom - A Playground for Genetic Algorithms and Online Multiplayer

Quick Start <br />

-- Master: Completely deprecated. Useful for single player I guess.<br /><br />
-- Multiplayer: Use 'multiplayer' branch. Requires a server to be launched, must have port 25565 to work.<br /><br />
-- AI-Branch: Initial Implementation of Genetic Algorithms. Requires a different repo of mine (CustomNeuralNetworks) to work correctly. Make sure on that repo to use the master branch.<br /><br />
-- AI-General: Does not work <br /><br />
-- Multi-threading: A better version of AI-branch that uses multithreading and deterministic physics to make genetics more consistent. If using this, use the deep-copy-and-activations branch of CustomNeuralNetworks.
